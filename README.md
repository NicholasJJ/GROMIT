# GROMIT
This is the open-source version of the GROMIT system, a bunch of paid assets that weren't being used have been removed, so probably everything still works... probably

Assets for the wizard, dungeon, skeletons, etc. in the adventure game (fitzgerald) are from Quaternius, Emojis are from OpenMoji
Runtime C# compilation is adapted from this project by Sebastian Lague: https://github.com/SebLague/Coding-Game
